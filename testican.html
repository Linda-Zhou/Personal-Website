    <h1>Testican-2 as a Protective Marker for Incident ESKD</h1>
    <div class="article-wrap">
      <p> <strong>Some backgrounds? </strong> <p>
      <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPOCK2">Testican-2</a> was recently identified as a podocyte-derived protein that is released into circulation by the kidneys and is positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and eGFR slope. However, whether testican-2 levels are associated with protection from end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is unknown. <p>
      <p> <strong>What data did we use? </strong><p>
      <p> We performed the analyses on three cohorts: <strong>ARIC</strong> (the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), <strong>AASK</strong> (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension) and <strong>CRIC</strong> (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort). We constructed cox proportional hazards model to study the associations of testican-2 with adverse kidney outcomes for each cohorts seperately, then conducted a meta analysis across the three cohorts. <p>
      <p> <strong>What statistical models did we use to address this problem? </strong><p>
      <p> We used descriptive statistics, including means and proportions to compare baseline characteristics by serum testican-2 tertile. Formal testing was performed using <strong>student’s t-test</strong> or <strong>Wilcoxon rank-sum test</strong> for continuous variables and <strong>chi-squared</strong> for categorical variables. <strong>Cox proportional hazards models</strong> were constructed to study the associations of testican-2 with: 1) incident ESKD; and 2) CKD progression. We adjusted for the covariates using three different models. Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and race. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for GFR, heart disease, smoking, systolic blood pressure, BMI, and diabetes. Model 3 was additionally adjusted for either log PCR in AASK and CRIC or log ACR in AASK. To evaluate for non-linear relationships, we also investigated the fully adjusted association between testican-2 and ESKD modeling testican-2 with cubic splines. Finally, we performed a <strong>meta-analysis</strong> of the association of testican-2 with incident ESKD and CKD progression across AASK, the CRIC study, and the ARIC study using the ‘meta’ package in R (version 4.0.3). A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. <p>
      <p> <strong> What did we find? </strong><p>
      <img src="testican.png" alt="testican" width="1500" height="800">
      <p> We found that higher testican-2 levels were associated with higher measured GFR (mGFR) in AASK, higher eGFR in the CRIC and ARIC studies, and lower albuminuria in all cohorts. Baseline testican-2 levels were significantly associated with incident ESKD in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and sex (Model 1); Model 1 + mGFR or eGFR + comorbidities (Model 2); and Model 2 + proteinuria (Model 3). In Model 3, the associations between testican-2 (per log2 increase) and incident ESKD were: AASK (HR = 0.61 [0.41, 0.93], P = 0.020), CRIC (HR = 0.78 [0.70, 0.99], P = 0.048), ARIC (HR = 0.22 [0.07, 0.66], P = 0.006), and meta-analysis (HR = 0.74 [0.65, 0.91], P = 0.0020).  <p>
